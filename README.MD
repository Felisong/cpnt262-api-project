# Hello! Welcome to my basic Web Weather App.

This is a web app to tell you the temperature according to your inputs. It is practice to get the hang of writing code and pulling from an API. I am making this for a class assignment, to show I can make an html basis, style it with css and script its functionality/ interactivity with Javascript.

I will be using cookies, local storage and session storage. I will also be manipulating the DOM according to the data I recieve from the API

## API 's

- [openeathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)
- [openweathermap geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

To access the site please go to:

```

```

I will be adding more to this later. I am just creating this so I can start work on it soon.
